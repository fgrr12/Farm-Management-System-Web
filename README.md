## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- PNPM (recommended package manager for workspaces)
- Firebase CLI installed globally (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Firebase projects configured for multi-environment setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd farm-management-system/web
```

2. Install dependencies using PNPM:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create the appropriate environment file based on your target environment:
   - `.env.local-develop` for local development with emulators
   - `.env.develop` for staging environment
   - `.env.production` for production environment

4. Start the development server:
```bash
# Local development with emulators

```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Firebase Emulator Setup (Local Development)

1. Install Firebase CLI and login:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

2. Start the emulator suite (from the API directory):
