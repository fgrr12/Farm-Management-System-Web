cd cattle
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Edit `.env.local` with your Firebase configuration.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Development Commands

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server (local-develop mode)
pnpm prod         # Start dev server (production mode)
```

### Building
```bash
pnpm build:production  # Build for production
pnpm build:develop     # Build for development
pnpm preview          # Preview built app
```

### Testing
```bash
pnpm test         # Run tests with Vitest
```

### Code Quality
```bash
pnpm lint         # Lint and auto-fix with Biome
pnpm format       # Format code with Biome
pnpm lint:check   # Check linting without fixing
pnpm format:check # Check formatting without fixing
```

### Internationalization
```bash
pnpm i18n:scan    # Scan for translation keys
pnpm i18n:format  # Format translation files

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password provider
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Add your Firebase config to `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Deployment

The project is configured for Firebase Hosting with separate environments:

```bash
# Build and deploy to development
pnpm build:develop
firebase deploy --only hosting:develop

# Build and deploy to production  
pnpm build:production
firebase deploy --only hosting:production
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the established code style (tabs, single quotes, 100-char lines)
2. Use the `@/` import alias for all internal imports
3. Add translations for new text content
4. Write tests for new features
5. Run `pnpm lint` before committing

## Code Style

- **Indentation**: Tabs (not spaces)
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
